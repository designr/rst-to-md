The stealthy and sneaky measure of modernization in our society.

Every modern social or economic system appoints someone who can be blamed if
something goes wrong; this may not be a bad thing — as it also means someone is
responsible and answerable for their actions — until blame becomes the most
predominant visible occurrence in that system’s day-to-day existence and
nothing else.

In many contexts, modernization is measured by comfort, and comfort by how
someone can delegate most of their humanly chores to either another human or a
machine — thus, if something goes wrong, there is someone or something to be 
blamed.

How blame is handled in a society tells a lot about that society and its culture.

The most important bit here, in this train of thought, is that blame should
never become the circus that it has become in our present day world. In fact,
it should be a measure of self-reflection — “What happened? How do we see it?
And, who are we willing to blame for it?” is pretty much the story that leaves
an individual or a society naked for anyone willing to academically observe
this system without bias or prejudice.
