there. I have finally migrated it to this blog on April 22, 2017.

**Tired. Lost. Confused.** I am 30 and I define those words. A younger, more
enthusiastic and energetic person might snap back at me – “if you’re 30 and
you’re all of that, you’ve wasted your 30 years”. I used to think that way too
when I was younger. Over the years, I’ve learned otherwise. I was fascinated
with creating things – fascinated by art, fascinated by technology, fascinated
by the idea of amalgamation of art and technology; but now I fail to understand
the things the world calls art. I fail to understand people’s fascinations. I
fail to understand progress as us humans have come to perceive it. I fail to
understand what sells. I fail to understand what you and I want from the next
moment. The next big thing does not excite me any more. The next big idea does
not make me happy, anxious or restless. I wonder whether I am lost or I’ve
found myself. There is this uncertainty I can’t shake away. There is this
uncertainty no one can apparently help me shake away.

Looking back, the only thing that’s still common between me from the past and
me today is the need to create. Back then, I didn’t worry too much about what I
wanted to create. I just did. Today, my decision to begin is clouded with
reason, clouded with experience, with justification; so clouded that it never
begins.

Today, I just want to create something that we can celebrate. Not something we
fight for. Not something we argue over. Not something I need to explain to you.
Not something that I need to justify. Not something I need to sell. Not
something I need to protect or worry about. But *something that we all can just
celebrate*.
